1 - What is credit risk and why it is important.

	creditor -> lender
	Debtor -> borrower

Examples of credit: 
	- credit cards
	- home ownership loans
	- asset financing: Firms use it to obtain the equipment they need
	
Credit risk: the likelihood that a borrower would not repay their loan to the lender. 

When the lender do not receive the owed principal, he will therefore suffer a substantial loss.

Default event: A borrower not being able to repay their debt is called default.

To avoid defaults, lenders must assess credit risk associated with each borrower VERY WELL.
Generally they require collaterals -> to increase the price of lending the funds.


Its important to know that lenders inability or failure to estimate borrowers probability of default can have grave consequences for lends and society in general.

About Expected Loss and its components: PD, LGP and EAD

** Types of  factors for expected loss

-- Borrower-specific factors
-- The economic environment

Definition of Expected credit loss: the amount a lender might lose by lending to a borrower.

EL = PD (probability of default) x LGD (loss given default) x EAD (exposure at default)


** Probability of default (PD)
- The borrowers inability to repay their debt in full or on time.

** Loss given default (LGD)
- Is the share of an asset that is lost if a borrower defaults. The proportion of the total exposure that cannot be recovered by the lender once a default has occurred.

** Exposure at default (EAD)
- The total value that a lender is exposed to when a borrower defaults.


** Unexpected losses: result of adverse economic circumstances.

Capital Adequacy, Regulations, and the Basel II Accord.

- In order to prevent financial disaster in society, Governmnet regulators imposed certain requirements on banks to make sure that banks conduct their business without risking the stability of the economic system.

** Regulators rules:
	-- Regulate bank operations and hence reduce risky behavior.
	-- Guarantee to the public that the banking system is in good health. 
- The bank must have sufficient capital in order to absorve some defaults. In other words, Capital Requirement (capital adequacy or regulatory capital).
