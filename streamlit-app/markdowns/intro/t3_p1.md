Based on the data presented above, this project provides relevant **credit score applications** that were implemented with the aim of exemplifying, in a practical way, the construction and deployment of machine learning models for this financial context. In addition, the project also has a **dashboard** for analyzing data in real time, which can highlights interesting insights to stackholders.

In summary, in this project, a **machine learning model** was developed to make the credit score inference in an intelligible way for the customer, that is, so that he understands the criteria used to generate the score he has. At this point, it is noteworthy that making clear the reasons that fostered the construction of a customer's credit score is a very important step from the point of view of **fairness and privacy legal issues.**


To achieve the goals mentioned above, the project relies on the use of *"two great powers"* commonly required in a professional data scientist: **machine learning algorithms** (i) and **statistics** (ii). Here, a caveat:
