# Modeling - How financial institutions actually model it (your credit score) ?

##### Who has never received emails such as "Leverage your pre-approved credit in order to finance your next car" or "We raised your credit limit" ?

What stands out at this point is that, nowadays, most of the time, we already have pre-approved credit at certain financial institutions. In previous times, the customer would have to request credit from the financial institution of interest, and go through a triage of bureaucracies until, finally, obtaining the requested credit.


How is that possible ? Considering the above context, large financial institutions are able to pre-approve credit for their base customers through the use of **statistical models** that consume **large volumes of data** (well known as Big Data). They consist of *socio sociodemographic data*, *payment history*, *transactional data* and much much more.  (More info: [Scoring models](https://www.debt.org/credit/report/scoring-models/))


In general, credit score modeling makes use of *statistical analysis techniques* and *machine learning models*. Examples of data used by banks for credit score inference are illustrated below.
