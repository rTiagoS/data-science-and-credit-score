Not just money, but also very common types of credit:
- *Credit Cards*;
- *Home Ownership Loans*;
- *Asset Financing* (NOTE: firms use it to obtain the equipament they need).

Considering this context, every credit operation carries a risk associated. This is commonly know as **credit risk**. In summary, credit risk is defined as the *likelihood* that a **borrower** would NOT repay their **loan** to the **lender**. Finally, the scenario where the borrower, in fact, do not full repay his debts leads to the **default event**.
