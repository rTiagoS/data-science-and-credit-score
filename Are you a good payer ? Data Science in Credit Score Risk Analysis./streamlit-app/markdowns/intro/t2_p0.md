# Reasons  - Why are they important ?

When dealing with banking and finance, these topics are among the most importants because the inability or failure to estimate borrowers probability of default can have grave consequences for lends and society in general. Then lenders must assess credit risk asssociated with each borrower vey well and generally they require collaterals to increase the price of lending the funds.

To illustrate an example of grave consequences as mentioned above, let's go back in the year 2008 when occured one of the greatest jolt to the global financial system in almost a century. So what caused the 2008 financial crash ? It is highly related to the availability of cheap credit context and lack of appropriate credit risk analysis. In practice, low-interest rates and low lending standards fueled a housing price bubble and encouraged millions to borrow beyond their means to buy homes they couldn't afford.
